This example program shows the usage of the I2C interface for simulating master
to access slave ROM flash device. It demonstrates the I2C master to write a 10 bytes
data pattern to the simulate I2C slave ROM flash device and then read back to check
the result.

This example program needs to connect two EVB boards via J27 pin1~3, the pin assignments
are shown as below, also remember to use UART cable in I2C master EVB to show master test
result, please see the I2C-EVB.jpg for HW setting.

     EVB1                   EVB2
J27.pin1 (SDA) <------> J27.pin1 (SDA)
J27.pin2 (SCL) <------> J27.pin2 (SCL)
J27.pin3 (GND) <------> J27.pin3 (GND) // Not necessary

Scenario:

Firstly initialize the I2C slave EVB, slave will act as ROM flash device and wait master
to write data. Secondly initialize the I2C master EVB, master will write 10 bytes data
pattern {0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9A, 0xBC, 0xDE, 0xF0, 0x12, 0x34} to slave and then 
read back to check the result. If consistent, mater UART will output test pass message.
