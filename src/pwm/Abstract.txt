This example program shows the usage of the PWM interface for driving
a speaker or buzzer. It demonstrates the PWM output channel 1 to output
different frequency and duty cycle signal to the speaker or buzzer to
play the notes.

The speaker or buzzer is connected to EVB by the following pin connection:

     Speaker                         EVB
" + " POSITIVE <--- connect ---> IDE_CON1.3  (PWM output channel 1)
" - " NEGATIVE <--- connect ---> IDE_CON1.43 (GND)


Scenario:

After initialized, the UART will send out the instruction messages and
then wait for receiving data. If the number 1 ~ 7 is received (i.e.
the '1' ~ '7' key is pressed on PC side under terminal emulation program),
the corresponding 'Do' ~ 'Si' frequency PWM signal is output to
speaker to play the note. That is, '1' for 'Do' note, '2' for 'Re' note
... and so on. If the "space" is received, the PWM stop output. And if
the "carriage return" is received, the program will exits. Otherwise,
it will bypass the received data and continue to wait for next receiving.
