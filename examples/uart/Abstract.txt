This example program shows the usage of the USART interface for asynchronous
communication. It demonstrates the UART to send/receive to/from a PC via
a terminal emulation program (Hyperterm, TeraTerm).

Scenario:

After initialized, the UART will send out the string "Press Enter to receive
a message" and then wait for receiving data. If the "carriage return" is received
(i.e. the 'Enter' key is pressed on PC side under terminal emulation program),
the UART will send out the "Hello World!" welcome message. Otherwise, it will
bypass the received data and continue to wait for next receiving.
