This example program shows the usage of the GPIO interface.
It demonstrates the GPIO to output/input application for 7-segments/switchs.

Scenario:

After initialized, the demo program will set GPIO direction for two 7-segments(output)
and seven switchs(input). And then set the switchs interrupt trigger mode to negative
edge and enable corresponding interrupts. After all setting is done, the program will
enter to a infinite loop, waiting for user to press switch1 ~ switch7 to trigger interrupts.
And when interrupt occurs, the two 7-segments will show the corresponding value 1 ~ 7.
