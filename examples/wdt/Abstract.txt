This example program shows the usage of WDT interface for resetting the lock-up system.
It demonstrates WDT to reset system when WDT takes a timeout.

Scenario:

WDT is initialized and Timer will periodically restart WDT.
After Timer restart WDT 10 times, we will stop Timer.
Then, the WDT timeout occurs, so it resets the system.

If WDT has IRQ stage, then program receives NMI interrupt at timeout.
It prints error message, and waits for system reset later.
