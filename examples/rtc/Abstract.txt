This example program shows the usage of the RTC interface for time interrupt. 
It demonstrates the second interrupt as elapsed 1 second and the alarm interrupt
as rtc_time count equal to alarm_time.

Scenario:

After initialized, the demo program will set the rtc_time to 0 and the alarm_time
1 minute.As 1 second elapsed, the program output UART message with "Second interrupt done". 
Similarly, as the rtc_time count equal to the alarm_time, the program will 
output UART message with "Alarm interrupt done".
